## Basic File Structure

SAI code is written in plain text files. 

Leading white space is semantically relevant, and MUST be formed using spaces, not tabs.

If present, the **reference** section must appear first, before any **object** definition.

### Reference - Global Variables

Declares global variables for use within the scope of the file. This is the preferred location to use `require`.

    reference:
      [varName] [expression]
      ...
      
     reference:
       RED ‘ff0000’
       Express require(‘express’)

     set colour to RED
     set app from Express

See the Keyword document for more.


### OBJECT - Object Definition

Except for global variables, all other SAI code exists within the context of an object definition.

**Format**

	object [ObjectName] [semver]

**Example**

	object PhysicsEngine 1.0.1

### INHERIT - Object Inheritance

Objects may inherit traits, tasks and contracts from other objects, and multiple-inheritance is supported.

	inherit: 
	  '[ObjectName] [semver]'
	  ...

\<\>detail


### CONTRACT - ImplementationContracts

A list of tasks that children of this object agree to implement.

	contract: 
	  [TaskName] {parameters?}
	  ...

	contract:
	  Get
	  Set
	  Iterator

Contract requirements are validated during the preparation of prototypes that inherit them. If the final prototype does not include concrete implementations of all contracted tasks, an exception is thrown.

_Type checking for contract task parameters is not yet implemented._

### GIVEN - Fixed Traits

Traits are object attributes. Their names should start with a lowercase letter to distinguish them from object tasks.

Givens are immutable object traits that are attached to the prototype and frozen in place. They cannot be changed in code. They are compiled once on prototype preparation and do not impact instantiation time. Givens are useful for static data, initializers and so on.

	given:
	  [traitName] [expression] 
	  ...
	
	given [traitName] [expression]

\<\>example

### INSTANCE - Instance Traits

Instance traits are set on construction of an object instance. They are initialized to the value given here during the pre-construction phase, and are ready for use in all object code including the  `Instatiate` task.

	instance:
	  [traitName] [expression]
	  ...

You don’t have to declare all of your object instance traits. Undeclared traits will be left uninitialized and, if accessed before being set, will have the value `undefined`.

\<\>example

### GET/SET - Dynamic Traits

Traits can be implemented with code, on **set** accepting a single value, and on **get** returning a single value. If you omit a **set** code path, then the trait is read-only.

	[traitName] get
	  [code block]
	set [parameter]
	  [code block]
 
**Example:**

	angle get
	  return \~Math.atan2(@y,@x)
	set as radians
	  @SetPolar @magnitude, radians
	
	magnitude get
	  return from \~Math.sqrt (@x\*@x) + (\@y\*@y)
	set as units
	  @SetPolar units, @angle


### TASK - Task Definition

Tasks are named object functions. Task names should start with Capital Letters to distinguish them from traits.

	[TaskName] task [parameters]
	  [code block]

**Example:**

	SetPolar task as units, radians
	  set @x to \~Math.cos(radians) \* units
	  set @y to \~Math.sin(radians) \* units
