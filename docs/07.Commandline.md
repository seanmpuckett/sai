## Command Line Compiler

[ short documentation ]

`sai-build` can be executed on the command line with a path to a SAI object. 

    ./sai-build [path/objectname]

A full prototype for that object will be written to STDOUT -- including all _inherited_ attributes/methods.  If your project has multiple objects, however, you will need to compile each object independently and save it to its own `.js` file.  

If running an app that uses pre-compiled versions of SAI objects, the run-time library will not use the dynamic compiled version of the loader, instead expecting all objects to be precompiled and available by `require`.

Example:

    > ./sai-build sample/Impossible/Impossible >impossible.js
    > node impossible.js
    
    Mathemetician's "Impossible" puzzle solver.
    Initial candidate count: 2304
    Phase 2 candidate count: 145
    Phase 3 candidate count: 86
    Results candidate count: 1
    Solution 1: X=4, Y=13; sum=17, product=52
    

The prototype will require the `sai-library` package.

Do not specify the `.sai` extension; this is assumed for you.

Code for the builder is located in the `builder.sai` script, have a look.
