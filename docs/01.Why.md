#### Whitespace matters

    while results's length < wordcount and duplicate > 0
      set word from GetWord
      unless tally\word or word's length < minimum
        push'd results word
      else
        dec duplicate
      inc tally\word

#### Every line begins with a verb.

    ply corpus as line
      set weight to 1
      ply line as word
        if number word 
          set weight to trial
        elsif word's length >= window
          push'd valid word
          if word's length > window
            AddWord it, weight

#### Just read it.

    ProcessArg task given path, branch
      if IsDirectory(path)
        every FS.readdirSync(path) as leaf
          local candidate PATH.join(path, leaf)
          if '.sai' is PATH.extname(leaf)
            ProcessArg candidate, branch
          elsif leaf isnt '.' and leaf isnt '..' and IsDirectory(candidate)
            ProcessArg candidate, PATH.join(branch, leaf)
      else 
        Build path, DestPath(path, branch)

---

Inline function calls use `from` before the verb clause.

    set path from PATH.join basepath, filename

Use `;` if necessary, to end a verb clause.
