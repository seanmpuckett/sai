## Basic Stuff 

Whitespace matters.

    set fruits list Apple, Banana, Cherry, Orange
    set basket empty
    every fruits as fruit
      unless fruit is 'Banana'
        set basket concat fruit

## 
Every line begins with a verb.

    
    

Inline function calls use `!` before the verb clause.

    set path !PATH.join basepath, filename

Use `;` if necessary, to end a verb clause.
